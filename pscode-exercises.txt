// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input: a number
Output: "Even" if the number is even, "Odd" if the number is odd


print "Enter a number:"
input number


if number % 2 == 0 then
    print number, "is Even"
else
    print number, "is Odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
for i <- 1 to 5 do
    print "Enter number ", i, ":"
    input number
    sum <- sum + number

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
 if number < min then
        min <- number
    endif
    
    if number > max then
        max <- number
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
average <- sum / 5
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
print "The average of the five numbers is:", average
print "The smallest number is:", min
print "The largest number is:", max
